Data Manipulation and Reporting with Power BI.

Led the development of an interactive and consolidated Power BI report for Zomato, a global restaurant aggregation and meal delivery service. The project involved integrating data from multiple Excel files representing various continents to provide a unified view of global operations. 

Key achievements included:
Data Integration: Imported and consolidated data from multiple Excel files into Power BI.

Data Transformation: Cleaned and standardized city names, removed unnecessary columns, and created separate tables for restaurant details and cuisines.

DAX Utilization: Developed DAX measures and columns for insightful analysis, including restaurant count, average cost, average rating, and cuisine count.

Interactive Reporting: Designed a multi-page report with drill-down capabilities, enabling detailed geographical and service-based filtering.

Visualization: Created intuitive and visually appealing dashboards aligned with Zomato’s theme, accessible on both web browsers and mobile devices.

This project empowered Zomato’s stakeholders to accurately assess business performance, identify top and low-performing restaurants, and make data-driven decisions.
